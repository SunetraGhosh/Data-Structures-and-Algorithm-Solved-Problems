Explanation of the line `struct Student* students = (struct Student*)malloc(numStudents * sizeof(struct Student));`:

1. `struct Student*`: This part declares a pointer variable named `students`. The `struct Student*` indicates that this pointer will point to a memory location holding data of type `struct Student`. It means that when we dereference the pointer (`*students`), we will get a `struct Student` value.

2. `malloc(numStudents * sizeof(struct Student))`: This part dynamically allocates memory from the heap using the `malloc` function. The `malloc` function stands for "memory allocation," and it is used to request a block of memory from the operating system. It takes one argument, which is the total number of bytes to be allocated.

In our case, we want to create an array of `numStudents` elements, each of which is of type `struct Student`. To determine the total number of bytes needed for this array, we multiply the size of one element (`sizeof(struct Student)`) by the number of elements we want (`numStudents`).

3. `(struct Student*)`: The `malloc` function returns a `void*` (a generic pointer to memory) that needs to be typecasted to the appropriate pointer type, in this case, `struct Student*`. That's why we have `(struct Student*)` before `malloc`.

The complete line `struct Student* students = (struct Student*)malloc(numStudents * sizeof(struct Student));` allocates enough memory to store an array of `numStudents` `struct Student` objects and stores the memory address of the first element of the allocated block in the `students` pointer variable.

After this line executes successfully, the `students` pointer points to the beginning of the dynamically allocated memory block, and you can use array subscript notation (e.g., `students[i]`) or pointer arithmetic to access individual elements of the array.
